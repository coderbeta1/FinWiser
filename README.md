For our brand logo we wanted to show that our platform gives you wings. Wings to your money to help you fly to your goal through our highly optimised financial adisory and planning platform

### Our Vision:
We aim to be a platform to help you plan all your financial needs. Whether it is trading, investing, budgeting, spends analysis or general saving. We keep a track you so you don't need to. While in its beginner phase we plan to grow into a one stop solution for any and all financial needs. We want to be the platform that comes to mind when you think of finance. We plan to be able to provide unique features like terms and conditions analyser, budget analyser, tax advising, etc. We believe in user privacy and thus we keep all user information end-to-end encrypted (subject to terms and conditions). There is no physical person behind this platform, our system is completely automated and involves pre-trained models so that your data stays with you. Currently while we only support features for individual entities, we want to be able to create joint accounts for families and bussinesses.
